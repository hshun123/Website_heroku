5. List of Technologies/API's Used: Flickr. We used Flickr api to show the the image of the type of food.

6. Detailed Description of the project (No more than 500 words): 
Our project is about a reservation system. The user can reserve the specific restaurant which registered on our application. To use our application, the user must register on our application and login as the authorized the user. 
After log-in, there are four main functionalities in our application. First one is to show up the available restaurant list in our application. The user can see the all lists of restaurants with details. If the user clicks the name of resturant, the application will redirect the user to reservation page in order to make a reservation. The second functionality is a Reserve Restaurant. The user can reserve the restaurnat by filling up some form. The third functionality is a reservation history of the user. This function will show the record of the reservation history. When the user made a reservation on the speicific restaurants. This is the function that used the data tables to match up the corresponding user id and bring up the data to our application.

9. List of Tables, their Structure and short description

 User
 
 user_id text PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, 
 user_password text NOT NULL, 
 user_Fname text NOT NULL,
 user_Lname text NOT NULL,
 user_phone_number text NOT NULL
 
 User table uses the email as the primary key of the table. The reason is that if the only user_id is an integer, the system would not be efficiently finding the unque id when we need to use the join with another table. By setting up the email as the primary key, the duplication of the user_id and validation of the table would be more efficinet. User has many to many relationship with the Reservation table. The one user can make many reservations on the many restaurants. 
 
 Restaurant
 
restaurant_id text PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, 
restaurant_password text NOT NULL, 
restaurant_name text NOT NULL, 
restaurant_type text NOT NULL, 
restaurant_address text NOT NULL, 
open_hour INTEGER NOT NULL, 
close_hour INTEGER NOT NULL, 
max_capacity INTEGER NOT NULL

Restaurnat has similar as the User table. It uses the email as the primary key of the table. The reason is that if the only restaurant_id is an integer, the system would not be efficiently finding the unque id when we need to use the join with another table. By setting up the email as the primary key, the duplication of the user_id and validation of the table would be more efficinet. Restauant has many to many relationship with the Reservation table. The one restaurant can have many user for reservations.

Reservation

user_id text NOT NULL, 
restaurant_id text NOT NULL, 
reserve_time INTEGER NOT NULL, 
num_people INTEGER NOT NULL, 
reserve_date DateTime NOT NULL, 
PRIMARY KEY(user_id,restaurant_id, reserve_date), 
FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES User(user_id), 
FOREIGN KEY(restaurant_id) REFERENCES Restaurant(restaurant_id)
Reservation is a relationship between the User and Restaurant containing extra information of the reservation. It will contain the reservation date, number of people that the user want to reserver, and reserve_time. This table has two primary keys (user_id, restaurant_id) and both primary key in the table will be used for foreign keys to make a relationship between the User and Restaurant.
